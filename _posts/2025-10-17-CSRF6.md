## Lab: CSRF where token is duplicated in cookie

This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to use the insecure "double submit" CSRF prevention technique.

To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

### Lab 6 Exploitation

Our goal is to exploit the vulnerable functionality in this website and make sure that the csrf vulnerability works so let's start 

First we will open burpsuite before doing anything so that we can see all of the requests that our website is doing, then login to `wiener` account with the credentials we have.

_Changing Email_

We will find that we can change our account email so put any email and click on the update email and we will see that it is updated now, after we have seen that it is updated let's see our request in burpsuite.

_Request_

We will see that this is the request that changed our email, but they have managed to put a csrf token and a csrf key to block our attack so let's see how can we bypass that.

Send your request to Repeater `Ctrl+R` and we will try to remove the csrf token and we will see it will not work, second we will try to change the request method and we will see also it will not work, and also if we changed only the csrf token we will see that it didn't worked so i think it is tied to the csrfKey cookie but may be not with the session cookie and also as we can see the csrf cookie and the csrf token have the same value and this can be vulnerable so how can we take advantage from this?

i will first see how many characters is this token because this defence mechanism probably accepts any csrf cookie that is in the same format so let's try it.

![img-description](/assets/img/PortSwigger/CSRF/6/size.png)
_Chars_

as we can see it is 32 characters so i will go to the request in the repeater and make the csrf cookie and the csrf token with the same value which is **32 characters** and let it be any 32 chars as you want and send your request.

_Chars_

and we can see that it worked, that's perfect but as we have learned from the past labs we can just send the request with another csrf token which is in the body and we can send it with the request and change it easily but now as we need also to change the **csrf** cookie which is in the request headers so how can we do this?

probably we will need to chain our csrf attack with another attack so upon searching i found this post talking about [HTTP Header Injection](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/http-header-injection/) which is when the attacker tricks the web application into inserting extra HTTP headers into legitimate HTTP responses, and i think this is exactly what we want in order for our attack to work.

Now we need to find a way to try our attack which we can also call a [CRLF Injection](https://www.invicti.com/learn/crlf-injection/) attack, we will find that there is a search function so i will see the request in burp and we can see that we have typed is now be shown in the response so i think this will be our targeted function.

_Trying to Search_

From what we read about this attack and how to do it we will now try it in here to inject our csrfKey cookie and see what is gonna happen.

![img-description](/assets/img/PortSwigger/CSRF/6/crlf.png)
_CRLF_

Perfect we can now see that the cookie is right there so now all we need is just to craft our exploit in order to send it to our victim, in our script we will make the victim visit the search function with our CRLF Injection containing our cookie and when it will make an error as the website can't see this as an image it will submit the form with our csrf token and change the email and we will be having every thing in place.

```
<html>
    <body>
        <form action="https://0a62009b033ec5a6808a031c00570036.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="Post">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned2@evil-user.net" />
            <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="dsajsdajdsalk5498sdasadssaddfads" />
        </form>
        <img src="https://0a62009b033ec5a6808a031c00570036.web-security-academy.net/?search=test%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrf=dsajsdajdsalk5498sdasadssaddfads%3b%20SameSite=None" onerror="document.forms[0].submit()">
    </body>
</html>
```

Change the data in this code with your lab relevant data, and make sure you have chosen a different mail again because no two users should have the same email.

now Deliver exploit to victim.

_Solved_

and you will see that the lab is solved.
