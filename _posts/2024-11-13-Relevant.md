### Scanning

We will start with scanning our machine 

```

### Gaining Access

#### SMB

After the scanning we will find that we are facing a windows machine with an smb server so let's start from there we will start by listing the smb shares

![img-description](/assets/img/Relevant/Relevant_Smb.png)
_Smb Shares_

we will find that there is an interesting shares so we will access it via anonymous login and we will find a file that contains what it's like a base64 encoded text

![img-description](/assets/img/Relevant/Relevant_Content.png)
_Shares Content_

So we will try to decode it and we will find that this is the output

```
Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123
Bill - Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$
```

it seems like it is some kind of credentials so we will try to authenticate to the server with it but we will get an error so it seems like a dead end

#### Http

So now as we can see in the scan that there are two http ports opened so we will see the content of the website and we will find that it is the default page for an IIS server

![img-description](/assets/img/Relevant/Relevant_Site.png)
_Website_

I will try to Fuzz the two ports to see what we can get and we will find that the **49663** port gave us a directory with same name as the smb share

![img-description](/assets/img/Relevant/Relevant_Fuzzing.png)
_Directory Fuzzing_

So i thought that why don't i search for the **passwords.txt** file in the directory as it is the same name as the smb share and as we can see we can view it

![img-description](/assets/img/Relevant/Relevant_FileContent.png)
_File Content_

As we can access files from the smb share from the web so why not we add a reverse shell on the smbshare and execute it via the web?

After searching i found that the compaitable reverse shell type with the IIS Server is an **aspx** file type so we will make it using msfvenom

![img-description](/assets/img/Relevant/Relevant_GA.png)
_Reverse Shell_

After i have used the curl command to access the reverse shell i have opened a listener so that i can get access and here we are we now have access and we can get the user flag

![img-description](/assets/img/Relevant/Relevant_User.png)
_User Flag_


### Privilege Escalation

#### Privileges Enum

In order to escalate our privilege first thing i will do is see what are my privileges on the system

![img-description](/assets/img/Relevant/Relevant_priv.png)
_Priv_

We will find that i have the **SeImpersonatePrivilege** Enabled

We will use a tool called **PrintSpoofer** to abuse the SeImpersonatePrivilege by creating a malicious token and impersonating it to escalate to SYSTEM.

You can find it here [PrinSpoofer](https://github.com/dievus/printspoofer)

#### Root Access

We will upload it to our machine via opening http server on our local machine after downloading the tool to transfer it

Then executing the command with the basic flags as in the readme file of the tool and we will find that we now have System access

_Root Access_

#### Root Flag
