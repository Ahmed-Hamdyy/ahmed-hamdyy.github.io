## Lab: Information Disclosure in error messages

This lab's verbose error messages reveal that it is using a vulnerable version of a third-party framework. To solve the lab, obtain and submit the version number of this framework.

### Lab 1 Exploitation

When we first open our website we will find that there is only a home page.

_Website_

In order to start exploring we will open a post from the ones that are infront of us and see what we can get in there.

_Post_

when seeing our page we will find that there is nothing to see there except of the `productId=1` parameter in the url, let's see how can we manipulate it first i tried to change it to another number like 0 but you will just get a not found 

so think about it the website is probably thinking that the user will just enter a number but what if we tried to enter a text?

you will find that the website gave us an error and we can see the version of the service in the bottom of the error submit and you will find that the lab has been solved.
