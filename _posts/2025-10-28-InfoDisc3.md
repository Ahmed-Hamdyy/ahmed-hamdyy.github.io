## Lab: Source code disclosure via backup files

This lab leaks its source code via backup files in a hidden directory. To solve the lab, identify and submit the database password, which is hard-coded in the leaked source code.

### Lab 3 Exploitation

Open the website and let's discover it and we can see that there is nothing in the website except the home page.

i tried to go on the posts to see if there is something to see there but also there is nothing, if you tried to change in the url parameters either putting a number or putting a text you will find nothing

let's see the source code, the developers sometimes leave some comments there that are very important, but also you will not find anything.

There is a very important file in the website that we must check when we first enter a website and test it for information disclosure which is ``robots.txt`` this file often list specific directories that the crawlers should skip.

_robots.txt_

and it seems that we have found an interesting endpoint, let's check it.

>Note:
>You can also fuzz the url with any simple wordlist and you will also find this endpoint

you will find that the endpoint contains indexing of the files, and there is a source code backup file so let's see this file content.
