### Scanning

Starting with scanning our target

```
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-27 16:32 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.187.41
Host is up (0.088s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```

We will see that there is http and ssh ports on our target so let's see the http

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/site.png)
_Website_

it is just a website tells us if we can root it so let's start to do it.

### Website Discovery

let's start with directory fuzzing on our website.

```
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u "http://10.10.187.41/FUZZ" 
```

We can see that there is a directory called panel which have a form to upload files on it.

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/fuzz.png)
_Hidden Dir_

So let's explore this directory

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/panel.png)
_Panel_

first i will try to upload any file and see what will happen, starting with a normal python file.

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/first.png)
_First upload_

we will see that it accepted it and from the source code the file is now in a directory called uploads and it is accessible, so now as we know from our scan and exploring our website this is a php website so we will try to upload php reverse shell on the server you will find a good reverse shell that works on any os in this [Github](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/src/reverse/php_reverse_shell.php) repo **don't forget to change the ip and port to your ip and port**

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/phprefuse.png)
_php upload_

### Gaining Access

we will see that the server rejects the php uploads, so i think we need to search for how to bypass this file upload problem.

i have tried one of the ways which i have encountered previously which is putting a . after the file extension and it worked

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/uploaded.png)
_shell upload_

now open a listener on your machine with the port you choosed in the shell file and click on the shell via the browser and you will find that you are now connected

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/user%20access.png)
_user access_

Now stabilize the shell using 

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

and let's get our user flag, you will find it in /var/www

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/userflag.png)
_user flag_

### Privilege Escalation

Now let's start getting root access, i will start with checking the files which have the SUID bit set using this command, SUID files run with the owner's privileges (often root!) instead of your user's.

```
find / -type f -perm -4000 -o -perm -6000 2>/dev/null
```

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/pythonsuid.png)
_SUID_

you will find that the python one is in our list which i think is an important one so let's head to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#%20+suid) and search for python

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/gtfo.png)
_GTFO_

we will find that it tells us that we need to execute this command in the image to gain root access so let's try it

![img-description](/assets/img/Rootme/root.png)
_Root Flag_

We got our root access and we can now access our root flag.
